## Course description
> *This class is a 2-day series running on Saturday, October 7th and Sunday, October 8th from 11:45am to 4pm each day.*
Please note: Class-time will be divided to cover and compare three of the major tools used to create designs for web and mobile applications (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Sketch) by completing simple exercises. 

### About the programs:
- **Photoshop** is Adobe's photo editing, image creation and graphic design software. The software provides many image editing features for raster (pixel-based) images as well as vector graphics. It uses a layer-based editing system that enables image creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency. Photoshop been the industry standard image manipulation program for so long that its name has even become a verb!
- **Illustrator** is an Adobe program used by both artists and graphic designers to create vector images. These images will then be used for company logos, promotional uses or even personal work, both in print and digital form. It can be used to create a wide range of sizes and media, including site mockups, assets, illustrations, charts, graphs, logos, diagrams, cartoons of real photographs, and more. 
- **Sketch** is a lightweight, modern, and powerful vector design software from Bohemian Coding. It is easy to learn, costs a fraction of the price of Photoshop and is quickly becoming the industry go-to. Sketch is perfect for designing on multiple devices and delivering assets quickly. *PLEASE NOTE: SKETCH IS MAC ONLY, BUT NON-MAC USERS MAY USE THIS TIME TO WORK ON AN ADOBE-BASED ASSIGNMENT PROVIDED BY THE INSTRUCTOR DURING THIS TIME*

#### Within each program, we will cover:
- The major pros and cons
- The programs' interfaces, from windows and workspaces to all those different tools and menu options (focusing on those used most frequently in a web workflow)
- Basic techniques for exporting, organizing, and working with files
- Using plugins and actions to get you designing quicker and more efficiently

#### Tech requirements:
- Your laptop. **A netbook or tablet is NOT a substitute.**
